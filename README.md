# CYBR-WANACRY-SVM

Project : Create a model to detect wanacry malware

Method: Utilized SVM model to identify wanacry from the rest of the traffic

Results: Model had .96 accuracy and .77 precsion

Details: Used the team method to pull data from hybrid-analysis (had to create api key in advance) and create dataframe. After the dataframe was created created appropriate variables to run on SVM. Once SVM was created and fit predictions were run and with the predicitons a confusion matrix was created and appropriate rates were calculated.
